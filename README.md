Piggy bank using Arduino

This is based on learnings from the the following posts https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Programmable-Piggy-Bank, http://justinpaulin.com/2012/10/10/getting-a-coin-acceptor-and-arduino-to-work-with-mame/ and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XanRVZgY6ow.

It uses the CH-926 Multi Coin acceptor (http://www.amazon.com/Sintron-Acceptor-Vending-Machine-Message/dp/B00C16P03I)
